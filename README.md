# üöÄ Image Compression Using Cubic B√©zier Curve
## What is this project about?
This project demonstrates an image compression method for 600x600 RGB images by applying cubic B√©zier curves. The technique significantly reduces storage space while maintaining visual quality, achieving a compression ratio of approximately 6:1.

## Overview
The compression works by dividing the image into blocks of 25 pixels and fitting a cubic B√©zier curve to each block. For each block, only 4 control points (P‚ÇÄ, P‚ÇÅ, P‚ÇÇ, and P‚ÇÉ) are stored. These control points are used to reconstruct the pixel values by calculating the curve's t values, providing an efficient way to encode and decode the image.

## Features
- **Efficient Storage:** Instead of storing each pixel, we store 4 control points per 25-pixel block.
- **Compression Ratio:** Achieves approximately 6:1 compression.
- **Visual Quality:** Maintains good visual fidelity of the original image through cubic B√©zier curve reconstruction.


## Methodology
- **Image Blocking:** The image is divided into 24x24 blocks, each containing 25 pixels.

- **Curve Fitting:** For each block, a cubic B√©zier curve is calculated by fitting 4 control points.

- **Compression:** Only the 4 control points (P‚ÇÄ, P‚ÇÅ, P‚ÇÇ, and P‚ÇÉ) are stored instead of the pixel values.

Decompression: The pixel values are reconstructed using the stored control points and calculated t values.
